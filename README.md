# 🪓 The Pleistoscene Project

**The Pleistoscene Project** is a hardcore, immersive survival game set in the Pleistocene epoch, built in Unity. Players will need to forage, hunt, craft primitive tools, and survive in a dynamic, evolving world shaped by authentic Ice Age ecosystems, seasonal changes, and extreme environmental conditions.

> ⚠️ This project is in early development and not intended for public release or playtesting.

## 🌍 Game Vision

Survival in **The Pleistoscene Project** is about more than managing meters—it's about learning to read the environment, anticipate danger, and adapt to a hostile, uncaring world. The game draws inspiration from real-world survival scenarios and paleoenvironmental research, with a strong emphasis on immersion and naturalistic gameplay.

### Core Design Goals

- **Authenticity**: Faithfully represent the challenges of survival during the Pleistocene.
- **Systemic Simulation**: Build layered systems (weather, animal behavior, seasonal shifts) that interact organically.
- **No Handholding**: Minimal UI, no objective markers—only what the player can see, hear, and infer.
- **Emergent Gameplay**: Let survival stories arise naturally from the world and its systems.
